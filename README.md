# Synthetic Data Generation for YOLOv5

This project aims to use deep learning algorithms to detect whether a product is counterfeit by analyzing images of boxes and their labels. In this repository we collect a number of labels to overlay them, randomly, on images of boxes. 

We scraped data using Google Images API.


## Dependencies
